# 📚 DBMS Digest

Welcome to **DBMS Digest** — a personal repository documenting my journey through Database Management Systems. This space will evolve as I continue learning and exploring key DBMS concepts, tools, and techniques.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This repository will gradually include:
- Core DBMS concepts and architecture
- SQL queries and practice problems
- Normalization and schema design
- Indexing, transactions, and concurrency control
- Notes from academic resources and real-world applications

## 📌 Purpose

To consolidate my understanding of DBMS through structured notes, examples, and hands-on practice. This repo serves as both a learning log and a reference for future projects.

## 🛠️ Status

Currently a work-in-progress. Content will be added and refined regularly as I progress through the subject.
